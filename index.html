					<h1>A Beginners Introduction to Idris</h1>

						<ul>
							<li>
								I am not an expert. I'm very much a beginner
							</li>
							<li>
								You should probably not run and rewrite your app in Idris
							</li>
							<li>
								I'm just a person who started learning Idris, got excited and
								wanted to get other people excited.

						<p>
							"Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language

						<ul>
							<li>
								Like Haskell, Idris is pure, meaning functions can't have side-effects.
							</li>
							<li>
								Unlike Haskell, Idris has dependent types. Types can depend on
								values. For example, you can write a function that combines two lists. In most langs we can specify that each list must contain
								the same types of items. In Idris we can say that, given a list
								`n` length and a list of `m` length, the function returns a list
								of `n + m` length

					<h2>Idris Flyby</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>
							What follows is a super high-level look at Idris syntax
							; there is a lot more to it, but that is beyond my
							current understanding and the scope of this talk.

				<h2>What Makes Idris Unique</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>
							Or more accurately, what makes Idris worth your time.
						</li>
						<li>
							It mostly looks like Haskell, but with a few extras.
							So what

					<h2>First-Class Dependent Types</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								First-class means there are no syntactic restrictions.
							</li>
							<li>
								Functions can comput types, types can contain values (as we
								saw).
							</li>
							<li>
								Anything you can write at the value level, you can write at
								the type level.

						<h2>Expressiveness</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>
									Idris encourages a style of development that puts as much
									emphasis on coming up with adequately precise types as it does
									on writing functions.
								</li>
								<li>
									Describe a problem with as much precision as possible, and
									encode that into the types.
								</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Sudoku</h3>
						<ul>
					    <li>A 9*9 grid of numbers</li>
					    <li>A 9*9 grid of positive integers</li>
					    <li>A 9*9 grid of positive integers between 1 and 9</li>
					    <li>A 9*9 grid, with 9 3*3 boxes, containing positive integers between 1 and 9, where each integer appears exactly once in each
							row, column, and box</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>
									Each of this describes a Sudoku game.
								</li>
								<li>
									But only the last is precise enough to make illegal states
									unrepresentable.

						<h3>All The Precision?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">
							no.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>
									Like most things in software there are tradeoffs
								</li>
								<li>
									Precise types reduce & possibly completely remove certain
									classes of bugs from your code.
								</li>
								<li>
									Too precise though and they become difficult to write, read
									and maintain.

					<h2>Type-Driven Development</h2>
					<small>Type -> Define -> Refine</small>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								Identify the data to be represented
							</li>
							<li>
								Design a type to represent that data, and decide what aspects
								of that data should be encoded in the type.
							</li>
							<li>
								Identify an operation to act on that data
							</li>
							<li>
								Establish the function input and output and decide if there there
								is enough precision. If not return to step 2.
							</li>
							<li>
								Implement the function. If difficult reconsider your type.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use the compiler as a tool to guide you
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Compiler As An Assistant</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								In Idris the compiler isn't just there to tell you when you make
								an error.
							</li>
							<li>
								The compiler can actively assist you in writing your program.
								The trick is getting types that expressive enough.
